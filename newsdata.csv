The ineffectiveness of traditional compliance tools, coupled with the limited time and resources available to privacy and security teams, leads to a limited ability to proactively discover inappropriate access to patient data.
“With millions of accesses to patient data occurring every day, it is nearly impossible to rely on complaint-driven and reactive reporting to mitigate every single inappropriate access,” said Lord.
“Leveraging advanced analytics makes it possible to give health systems the ability to share health data safely and securely by auditing every access to patient data.
